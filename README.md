# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) blueprint, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

# Prerequisites

## Running local Blueprint version for development

During development of blueprint, please note the below steps. They are very important.

1. Link your blueprint globally 

Note: If you do not want to link the blueprint(step 3) to each project being created, use NPM instead of Yarn as yeoman doesn't seem to fetch globally linked Yarn modules. On the other hand, this means you have to use NPM in all the below steps as well.

```bash
cd ant-design
npm link
```

2. Link a development version of JHipster to your blueprint (optional: required only if you want to use a non-released JHipster version, like the master branch or your own custom fork)

You could also use Yarn for this if you prefer

```bash
cd generator-jhipster
npm link

cd ant-design
npm link generator-jhipster
```

3. Create a new folder for the app to be generated and link JHipster and your blueprint there

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app

npm link generator-jhipster-ant-design
npm link generator-jhipster (Optional: Needed only if you are using a non-released JHipster version)

jhipster -d --blueprint ant-design

```
